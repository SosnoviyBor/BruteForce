  Breaking an owned lock will alert NPCs in two ways:

  1. If you're in their line of sight -> LoSBaseDist - SneakSkill * SneakMultiplier

  2. If they're close enough to you (ignores walls) -> SoundBaseDist - WeaponSkill * WeaponSkillMultiplier

  For reference, river Odai in Balmora is around 1000 units wide. And Ra'virr is aroung 600 units away from his locked chest behind the staircase.
