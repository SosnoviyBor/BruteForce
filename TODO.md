## Balancing changes
- OPTIONAL Weapon efficiency (two handed > one handed > h2h)
<!-- - OPTIONAL Weapon degradation (like LockLevel*10 damage per lock, maybe higher). If weapon doesn't have enough durability, it couldn't be used for breaking the lock -->
- OPTIONAL Weapon filtering (just because)
- Lock hit chance presets
  - Skill-based (some formula that includes weapon skill, agility and fatigue)
  - Constant and gradual (2 hits 0-25lock, 3 hits 26-50lock, 4 hits 51-75 and 5 hits 76-100)
  - Random (25% to hit the lock regardless of lock level)

## Cosmetic
- Better lock splitting and bending impact
  - Better SFX (pixabay?)
  - Maybe changing the material to the metal in Impact Effects?
- Chance to trigger trap when breaking the lock
- Triggering the trap if player hits the door/container without lock
- Add SFX for misses too
